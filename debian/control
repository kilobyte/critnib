Description: ordered map data structure with lock-free reads
 Critnib is a data structure that provides a very fast equal and
 less-than/greater-than searches; it is a mix between DJBerstein's
 critbit and radix trees.  While in bad cases it has worse memory use
 than binary trees, it works well on real-life data which tends to
 have a limited number of "decision bits":
  * fully random: divergence happens immediately
  * malloc addresses: clumps of distinct bits in the middle
  * sequences: only lowest bits are filled
 .
 This library ships only uintptr_t→uintptr_t mappings, optimized for
 reads from a very critical section but not so frequent writes.  Other
 variants also exist (such as fully lock-free writes, keys of arbitrary
 length), and can be added upon request.
