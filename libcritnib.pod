libcritnib - an ordered map data structure with lock-free reads

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<#include E<lt>critnib.hE<gt>>

Link with I<-lcritnib>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Functions:

=over

=item B<critnib *critnib_new(void);>

Creates a new empty critnib structure.

=item B<void critnib_delete(critnib *>I<c>B<);>

Destroys and frees the memory.  Note that removed items are reused but won't
have their memory freed until this function is called.

=item B<int critnib_insert(critnib *>I<c>B<, uintptr_t >I<key>B<, void *>I<value>B<, int >I<update>B<);>

Adds a key:value pair to the critnib structure.  If I<update> is non-zero,
an already existing key has its value updated, otherwise the function returns
B<EEXISTS>.  It may return B<ENOMEM> if we're out of memory, or 0 if all went
okay.

=item B<void *critnib_remove(critnib *>I<c>B<, uintptr_t >I<key>B<);>

Removes a given key from the structure.  Its associated value is returned,
or 0 (NULL) if there was no such key.

=item B<void *critnib_get(critnib *>I<c>B<, uintptr_t >I<key>B<);>

Obtains a value for a given key, or 0 (NULL) if not present.

=item B<void *critnib_find_le(critnib *>I<c>B<, uintptr_t >I<key>B<);>

Searches for the largest key not exceeding the argument, and returns its value.
